    You have to know that the creoles ‚â† an ethnic group

   <h3>The different meaning of the term "creole"</h3>
     <h4> A. Before the end of slavery</h4>
       <p>
         This term was originally used to distinguish the persons born in Louisiana 
         and most generally the persons born in French or Spanish colonies from those born elsewhere.
         <br>
         This term was reserved to the white people because at this time 
         black people were not concerned by this calling because of their state of slaves so they were not considered as human being
       </p>

    <h4>B. After the end of slavery</h4>
     <p>
        The black people became also concerned by this
        calling because they were no longer slaves so they were also considered as human being 
        even if some white creole were against that.
     </p>

    <h4>C. Nowadays</h4>
       <p>
         Currently, the term ‚Äúcreole of Louisiana‚Äù designates the descendent of these people. 
         Their complexion doesn‚Äôt matter. They can be white, dark-skinned or light-skinned even if most of the current creoles are dark-skinned .
         <br>
         Unfortunately we can‚Äôt estimate how many there are because some creole identify
         themselves as Cajun(an ethnie in Louisiana). I mean the white creoles of course and others identify themselves
         as African American. I mean the dark and light-skinned and there are also some persons from other
         communities like the native americans and the cajun who identify themselves as creoles so we can‚Äôt count
         them precisely.

 <!-- Partie 2: The language they use to speak-->
   <section class='cat√©gorie_1'>
  <h2>2. The language they use to speak</h2>
  <p class="centre">The Louisianan creoles speak.....
     <br>
     English......
     <br>
     <span class='gen√©'>üòÖ</span>
     <br>
     I think it is quite logical because they live in Louisiana which is English speaker country's state.
     <br>
     <span class="mais">But....</span>
     <br>
  </p>

  <p>
      They speak their own traditional language which is called... :
    
      <ul>
        <li>The lousiana creole </li>
        <li> Kouri-Vini </li>
        <li>Kr√©y√≤l</li>
        <li>Frans√©</li>
        <li>Kr√©yol La Lwizi√†n</li>
        <li>Gombo french</li>
        <li>Courimavini</li>
        <li>fran√ßais n√®g</li>
        <li>n√®g</li>
      </ul>
   </p>

   <p>
       This language actually has a lot of namesüòÖ

       <br>

      It belongs to the group of the creoles languages which use a french vocabulary. You can see it in a lot of words like for example...
      <br>
      <span class="mais">The numbers</span>
   </p>
    
    
    <img src="tableau_de_la_langue_cr√©ole.png" alt="tableau avec les chiffres en cr√©oles, fran√ßais et anglais" width="264.5px" height="327.5px" title="Try to read the creole numbers with the accent (like Adam)" />
  
   <p>
    The kouri-vini is currently mainly spoken by Creole, but also by Cajun and Native American.
    It is spoken by less than 10 000 speakers so unfortunately this language is endangered.

<!--Partie 3.2: The creole music-->
   <div class="cat√©gorie_2">
      <h3>3,2. The creole music</h3>
      <p>
        The creoles had a very important musical influence in Louisiana. They created their own musical genre in
        the 1920‚Äôs. It is called....
        <br>
        <br>
        <img src="zydeco_picture.jpeg" alt="picture of Zydeco" width="400px" height="400px"/>.
        <br>
        <br>
        It was created by black Creole communities on the prairies of southwest Louisiana.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the beginning, Zydeco was only sung in <span class="gras">Louisiana French or Creole</span>. But during the twentieth century,
        some creole artists began to add a new language in this type of music: <span class="gras">English</span> Today, Zydeco is sung in
        English, Louisiana Creole and Colonial Louisiana French.
      </p>
      <p>Zydeco is the melting pot of different music styles. It mixes:
        <ul>
          <li>blues</li>
          <li>jazz</li>
          <li>Cajun Music (was originally called "Old Louisiana French Music").</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h4> The main musical instruments of Zydeco</h4>
       <h5>The cajun accordion</h5>
       <img src="cajun_accordion_picture.jpeg" alt="cajun accordion picture" width="333px" height="276px">

       <h5>The piano accordion</h5>

       <h5>The vest frottoir</h5>
       <img src="vest_frottoir-picture.jpeg" alt="pcture of a vest frottoir">
       <p>
        The last one is not very known in the western world
        <br>
        This very original instrument looks like a washboard and is usually worn over the shoulders. 
        To make music with, you have to use spoons and make some noise with them.
